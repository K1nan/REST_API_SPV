# Comparison of REST and GraphQL APIs

This repository contains the source code, data, and results for the **"Comparison of REST and GraphQL APIs"** study. The project evaluates the performance, efficiency, and suitability of REST and GraphQL APIs for Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) applications. It also investigates the impact of API management tools, **WSO2** and **3Scale**, on API performance.

---

## Project Goals

1. **Evaluate Web API Technologies**:
   - Compare REST and GraphQL APIs in terms of response time, efficiency, and resource utilization.
   - Highlight the advantages and disadvantages of both technologies for specific use cases.

2. **Analyze API Managers**:
   - Assess the performance of REST and GraphQL APIs deployed on two API managers: **WSO2** and **3Scale**.
   - Evaluate how API managers affect response time and scalability.

3. **Contribute Insights**:
   - Provide valuable insights for SPV and other organizations when selecting an API technology and API management solution.
   - Offer documented source code and experimental data to ensure transparency.
